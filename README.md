Packages for performing Semiclassical Transition State Theory (SCTST) Calculations

SCTST is a method used to estimate thermal reaction rate constants using a fourth-order expansion of the potential energy surface at the transition state (harmonic frequencies and anharmonic constants). A summary of these methods can be found in:
S. Greene et al. Adv. Chem. Phys. 163 (2018), 117.
Frequencies and anharmonic constants can be calculated either from ab initio electronic structure theory, or from an analytical potential energy surface in hyperspherical coordinates for comparison to quantum reactive scattering calculations.
